Victor's Graphical Chess Program's CHANGELOG
Here you can find a somewhat curated and chronological list of notable changes
The following entries deal mostly with changes to the actual software not with changes to the documentation, etc.
NOTE: These entries may not contain every single minor change but should contain all major changes

2021-01-23	version 00-0001
	Added a draw as a possible result of a match.
	NOTE: Currently a match can only result in a draw as a result of a stalemate.

	source file changes
		* src/move.c (movePiece): now checks for stalemate after a move
		* src/draw.c (drawGameOverText): now (if a match results in a draw) the text is "DRAW"
		* src/main.c (gameOver): now handles matches that result in a draw

	header file changes
		* include/vgcp.h: updated function prototypes,
			changed the default window size to 1000x1000

2021-01-24	version 00-0002
	Made the code nicer (switched the color variable(s) to "color_t" from "bool") and made other optimizations.

	source file changes
		* (almost) all: switched color variables to "color_t",
			optimized code

	header file changes
		* inclue/vgcp.h: created new macros,
			created the "color_t" type,
			updated function prototypes

2021-02-02	version 00-0003
	Now warns user on runtime when using the _DEBUG and warns user on runtime & compilation when the _NO_PERSPECTIVE_CHANGE is disabled,
	now moves use the structure "move"

	source file changes
		* src/main.c (main): Now warns of "unwanted" options being used on runtime (_DEBUG & _NO_PERSPECTIVE_CHANGE)
		* src/main.c (handleMousebuttonEvent): Updated function call to movePiece
		* src/move.c (movePiece): updated function arguments, optimized handling of castling,
			now uses the structure "move"

	header file changes
		* include/vgcp.h: updated function prototypes,
			now warns of _NO_PERSPECTIVE_CHANGE not being enabled,
			created the structure "move"

2021-02-02	version 00-0004
	Created the "label" structure, optimized code, etc

	source file changes
		* src/init.c (loadMedia): now uses the "label" structure,
			loads the texture rectangle & background during creation and not during drawing.
		* src/draw.c (drawGameOverText): uses the "label" structure now
		* src/piece.c (mapKingPotentialMoves): optimized castling

2021-02-03	version 00-0005
	Created the move list, which currently doesn't do anything useful.
	
	source file changes
		* created a new source file src/move_list.c
		* str/move.c (movePiece): now adds to the list of moves after move

	header file changes
		* include/vgcp.h: added the move list structure, updated prototypes

2021-02-05	version 00-0006
	Added "capture" boolean to the move structure and added support for the 50-move rule (= added the halfmove clock), fixed a bug (crashing on clicking off board)

	source file changes
		* src/move.c: created new function for updating the halfmove clock (updateHalfmoveClock)
		* src/move.c (movePiece): now updates the halfmove clock after piece has moved 
			and checks for a draw as a result of the 50-move rule.

	header file changes
		* include/vgcp.h: added the capture boolean to the move structure, updated prototypes

2021-02-06	version 00-0007
	Now stores the game state into the (new) position structure. The position structure stores the board, castling rights, the previous move and the player that will move next. This will be useful when checking for repitition (when storing a list of them).

	source file changes
		* created a new source file for updating and initializing the current position (src/position.c)
		* almost all: Now uses the position structure.
		* src/move.c: created a new function specifically to handle castling (castleKing),
			created a new function specifically to handle adding a potential castling move
			(addPotentialCastling)
		* src/move.c (movePiece): no longer handles castling, 
			now removes castling rights here if rook or king moves
		* src/move.c: (addPotentialMove): no longer handles adding potential castling

	header file changes:
		* include/vgcp.h: created the position structure, updated prototypes

	EDIT: removed blank line (2021-02-12)

2021-02-12	version 00-0008
	Changed the moveList structure into the positionList structure which stores the entire chess position. The position list will be used to check repitition.
	
	source file changes
		* created a new source file for the position list (src/position_list.c)
		* src/move.c (movePiece): now updates the position list (not the move list)

	header file changes
		* include/vgcp.h: created the position list structure, updated prototypes 

2021-02-17	version 00-0009
	Implemented En Passant.

	source file changes
		* src/move.c: created new functions for en passant (enPassant, addPotentialEnPassant)
		* src/piece.c (mapPawnPotentialMoves): now checks if en passant is a potential move and adds it if it is

	header file changes
		* include/vgcp: added "potentialEnPassant" to the tileState enum, updated prototypes 

2021-02-23	version 00-000A
	Implemented threefold repitition. If the same position repeats thrice then the game results in a draw. The implementation isn't perfect because (for example) it doesn't take into account the "En Passant" rights when counting repetitions. Also, fixed a compilation error related to variable definitions in the header files and some other bugs.

	source file changes
		* src/main.c: now defines variables here
		* src/move.c (movePiece): now calls the "checkForRepitition" function to check for threefold repitition
		* src/positionList: created new function for checking repitition (checkForRepitition) and created related static functions (compareBoards, compareCastlingRights) 
		* src/positionList (addToPositionList): optimized memory usage (wipes the list clean if an irreversible move occurs)

	header file changes
		* include/vgcp: now all variable definitions are "extern"s
