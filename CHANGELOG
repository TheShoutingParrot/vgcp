Victor's Graphical Chess Program's CHANGELOG
Here you can find a somewhat curated and chronological list of notable changes
The following entries deal mostly with changes to the actual software not with changes to the documentation, etc.
NOTE: These entries may not contain every single minor change but should contain all major changes
